    "**Machine Learning Lifecycle**\n",
    "Letâ€™s start with understanding the overall machine learning lifecycle, and the different steps that are involved in creating a machine learning project. Broadly, the entire machine learning lifecycle can be described as a combination of 6 stages. Let's break these stages for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Problem Definition**\n",
    "The first and most important part of any project is to define the problem statement. Here, we want to describe the aim or the goal of our project and what we want to achieve at the end. The project picked for this particular session is automating the loan eligibility process. The task is to predict whether the loan will be approved or not based on the details provided by customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: Hypothesis Generation**\n",
    "Once the problem statement is finalized, we move on to the hypothesis generation part. Here, we try to point out the factors/features that can help us to solve the problem at hand.As a starting point, here are a couple of factors that I think will be helpful for us with respect to this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amount of loan: The total amount of loan applied by the customer. My hypothesis here is that the higher the amount of loan, the lesser will be the chances of loan approval and vice versa.\n",
    "Income of applicant: The income of the applicant (customer) can also be a deciding factor. A higher income will lead to higher probability of loan approval.\n",
    "Education of applicant: Educational qualification of the applicant can also be a vital factor to predict the loan status of a customer. My hypothesis is if the educational qualification of the applicant is higher, the chances of their loan approval will be higher.\n",
    "These are some factors that can be useful to predict the loan status of a customer. Obviously, this is a very small list, and you can come up with many more hypotheses. But, since the focus of this article is on model deployment, I will leave this hypothesis generation part for you to explore further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 3: Data Collection**\n",
    "After generating hypotheses, we get the list of features that are useful for a problem. Next, we collect the data accordingly. This data can be collected from different sources.We know certain features that we want like the income details, educational qualification, and so on. And the data related to the customers and loan is provided at the datahack platform of Analytics Vidhya. Here is a summary of the variables available for this particular problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan Prediction dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some variables related to the loan, like the loan ID, which is the unique ID for each customer, Loan Amount and Loan Amount Term, which tells us the amount of loan in thousands and the term of the loan in months respectively. Credit History represents whether a customer has any previous unclear debts or not. Apart from this, we have customer details as well, like their Gender, Marital Status, Educational qualification, income, and so on. Using these features, we will create a predictive model that will predict the target variable which is Loan Status representing whether the loan will be approved or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 4: Data Exploration and Pre-processing**\n",
    "After collecting the data, we move on to explore and pre-process it. These steps help us to generate meaningful insights from the data. We also clean the dataset in this step, before building the model. Here, we will explore the dataset and pre-process it. The common steps under this step are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Univariate Analysis\n",
    "Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "Missing Value Treatment\n",
    "Outlier Treatment\n",
    "Feature Engineering\n",
    "We explore the variables individually which is called the univariate analysis. Exploring the effect of one variable on the other, or exploring two variables at a time is the bivariate analysis. We also look for any missing values or outliers that might be present in the dataset and deal with them. And we might also create new features using the existing features which are referred to as feature engineering. Again, I will not focus much on these data exploration parts and will only do the necessary pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 5: Model Building**\n",
    "Once we have explored and pre-processed the dataset, the next step is to build the model. Here, we create predictive models in order to build a solution for the project.Since it is a classification problem, we can use any of the classification models like the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 6: Model Deployment**\n",
    "Once you have the solution, you want to showcase it and make it accessible for others. And hence, the final stage of the machine learning lifecycle is to deploy that model. It will be our main focus today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will take care of the 1st 5 stages the we will use streamlit to deploy our model."
