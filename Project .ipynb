Don’t stop at finding the solution or creating a prototype for a recommendations system or a fintech chatbot, go the extra mile, deploy it,sell it , share it with your peers to use it, collect some analytics. This shows how passionate you are about what you do and to what extent you can go to learn new technologies and methods."

    "☑First   it’s hard to stand out when  everyone has Coursera,zindi,Udemy,fastai and Kaggle (all great but much too common) on their resume or Portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "☑Provide a portfolio to showcase projects that demonstrate technical and product sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ DON’T add a project that uses a generic dataset and models to do a generic task (ex. sentiment classification on news reviews or predicting mortality on the Titanic). These are great to learn from initially but not great to showcase for a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ DO pick a unique dataset (or go web-scrape your own!) and apply simple → complex models unique to your task\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ DON’T merely dump a notebook full of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Provide necessary details when posting your project (objectives, highlight and takeaways). This is also the place to showcase your product/business sense which is key for a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ DON’T just apply a set of complex models on random datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ DO work on projects in industries you’re applying to with a class of models that make sense. The familiarity in the space will come across as major advantage.\n",
    "(Uses salesforce app exchange, shopify app store,  zendesk app marketplace ,stripe partners,  slack etc to get B2B ideas )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ DON’T just focus on modeling in your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ DO incorporate full-stack components (streamlit , databases, apis, devops, etc.) to show you can create a product and not just run code on a jupyter notebook."
